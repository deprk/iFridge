# fridge_app

iFridge helps you keep track of all the food you have at home. It has a built-in database of expiration dates of certain foods. Each food has a "type of food", "days to expire", "quantity", and "name" attribute. This helps the user sort their fridge items based on what they are looking for. It is also able to find recipes that match your ingredients or the foods that will expire first. It has a shopping list where you can see the food you have in a horizontal scroll. The vertical scroll on the page will show what you need to buy in a checklist format. The shopping list feature helps the user while they are shopping for groceries. No more wondering whether or not you have the ingredients for a recipe you just searched up, everything is all in one place. When the user checks a food off the list, it will ask for the quantity of the food and input it automatically into your fridge. Lastly, our input has a camera feature that allows the user scan their food into their fridge. The user can manually input it as well, however, we thought that providing a scanning function would be better.
